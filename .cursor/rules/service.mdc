# DEPRECATED

This rule file has been deprecated and split into two more focused files:

- **@service-layers.mdc** - Service organization, domain separation, layering patterns
- **@service-implementation.mdc** - Service implementation details, DTOs, error handling, logging

Please refer to these new files instead.
